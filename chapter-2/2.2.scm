; Consider the problem of representing line
; segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair
; of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a
; constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and
; end-segment that define the representation of segments in
; terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented
; as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordinate.
; Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and
; selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation.
; Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a
; procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as
; argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates
; are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints).
; To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

(define (make-point x y) (cons x y))
(define (x-point point) (car point))
(define (y-point point) (cdr point))

(define (make-segment start end) (cons start end))
(define (start-segment segment) (car segment))
(define (end-segment segment) (cdr segment))

(define (midpoint segment)
  (let ((x-avg (/ (+ (x-point (start-segment segment))
                     (x-point (end-segment segment)))
                  2))
        (y-avg (/ (+ (y-point (start-segment segment))
                     (y-point (end-segment segment)))
                  2)))
    (print-point (make-point x-avg y-avg))))

(midpoint (make-segment (make-point 0 0) (make-point 2 3)))
