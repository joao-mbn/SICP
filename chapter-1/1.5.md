Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is
using applicative order evaluation or normal-order evaluation.
He defines the following two procedures:

```scheme
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0) 0 y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression:

```scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation?
What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation?
Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

```scheme

;applicative-order
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
; ... infinite loop trying to resolve p

;normal-order
(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
0
; it will resolve x, whereas y would be lazily evaluated, but the alternative block on the if statement is never reached, thus the infinite loop of p is never entered. See p. 20 and 21.
